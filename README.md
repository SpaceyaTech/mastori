# Mastori: A SpaceYaTech Blog App made in Django
Mastori is a community-driven open-source project that aims to provide a simple and efficient blogging platform built with the Django Rest Framework. 

# Overview

The SpaceYaTech Content Management system is an open-application that lets users to quickly publish content and share it with ease to their audience. Inspired by existing CMSes like Hashnode, Wordpress, DEV and Joomla, we felt the need to create an African CMS created by young Africans looking to learn by contributing to Open Source. SpaceYaTech opted for a CMS as the debut open source project because of the technicalities involved in creating, maintaining and scaling a CMS. A CMS poses great technical challenges and a great learning opportunity for those looking to grow their tech skills.
For a more detailed overview of the project, read through the [CMS Backend wiki](https://github.com/SpaceyaTech/CMS-Backend-Repository/wiki) 

The project is designed to help developers build their own blogging website or add blogging functionality to an the SpaceYaTech website with ease.
